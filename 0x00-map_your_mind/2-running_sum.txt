**This program will calculate a running sum and stop when a negative number is encountered**

function firstSum (n1) {
	
	Check if n1 is greater than 0 THEN 
	return result to user 

}
end

function runningSum (n) {

	For every inputted number 
		IF n is greater than 0 
THEN add n to firstSum

	ELSE IF n is less than 0 

return the result to user 
}
end 

{
In the main function

print prompt "Input number"
         
  	Take the first number from the user
	Print the result to the user 

  	print prompt “Input another number”
If greater than zero add to take number to function firstSum and add 
	else if less than zero

Print result to user  
}
