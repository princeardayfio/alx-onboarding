**This program reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order**

{
In the main function 
	
	Print prompt “Input three numbers”
	
	Take the three numbers from the user and represent as n1, n2 and n3 

	Define variables for 
H= Highest Value number 
				M= Middle Value number
				L= Lowest Value number
}
			

function sortedOrder (n1, n2, n3) {

	FOR three numbers inputted 
		IF n1 is greater than n2 and n3 
		Set as H

			ELSE IF n2 is greater than n1 and n3 
			Set as H

				ELSE IF n3 is greater than n1 and n2
				Set as H

		IF n1 is less than n2 and n3
		Set as L 
		
			ELSE IF n2 is less than n1 and n3 
			Set as L 

				ELSE IF n3 is less than n1 and n2 
				Set as L 

		IF H and L is not equal to n1 THEN 
		Set M as n1 

			ELSE IF H and M is not equal to n2 THEN 
			Set M as n2 

				ELSE IF H and M is not equal to n3 THEN 
				Set M as n3

return result to user from lowest to highest as L,M,H 
}
